##Core APIs
The IWC Bus defaults to having the following 4 APIs:

 * [Data API](data/overview.md):
A simple key/value JSON store for sharing common resources amongst applications. Has backend connections for
persisting storage if applications choose to.


 * [Intents API](intents/overview.md):
Handling for application intents. Follows the idea of android intents. Allows applications to register to handle
certain intents (ex. graphing data, displaying HTML). Like android, the IWC Intents api presents the user with a
dialog to choose what application should handle their request.


 * [Names API](names/overview.md):
Status of the bus. This api exposes information regarding applications connected to the bus.


 * [System API](system/overview.md):
Application registrations of the bus. This api gives connections to the bus awareness of what applications the bus
has knowledge of. Different then the names api, these application's are not the current running applications, rather
these are registrations of where applications are hosted and default configurations for launching them. This gives
IWC clients the capability to launch other applications.
