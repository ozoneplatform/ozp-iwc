##API Responses
Since the IWC operates asynchronously, all requests receive a response sent back to a client that resolves the actions
promise.

The promise structure is as follows:

```
client.${Api}().${Action}(...).then(function(res){...});
```

The `then` of the promise receives a formatted response object. The contents of the response **res** are as follows:

**response**: {String} The result of the request. "ok" means a successful operation.

**src**: {String} The sender of the message.

**dst**: {String} The receiver of the message.

**entity**: {Object|String} The payload of the response. If an action is to return data it will be in this object.

***

**NOTE**: This guide uses the `then` and `catch` resolution/rejection's of promises only as needed to demonstrate use.
If they are not demonstrated in an example that does not mean they are not useable. All actions will resolve/reject with
the response received from the Bus.

***

####Response Example
The variable `foo` contains the value stored at `/foo` once the api request receives its response.

```
var dataApi = client.data();

var foo;

dataApi.get('/foo').then(function(res){
    foo = res.entity;
});
```

The value of `res`, the resolved object of the list request, is formatted as follows:

```
{
    "response":"ok",
    "src":"data.api",
    "dst":"4e31a811.31de4ddb",
    "entity":{
        'bar': "buzz"
    },
    "ver":1,
    "time":1424897169456,
    "msgId":"i:1397"
    "replyTo":"p:704",
}
```

**response**: Seeing a response of 'ok' is indication that the request was handled without error.

**src**: The origin of the response. With the request to **get** the resource `/foo` sent to the Data API, the
response was generated and sent from the Data API module.

**dst**: The destination of the response. Each IWC client is assigned a unique address local to the IWC Bus.
This address designates who should receive the data being transmitted.

**entity**: The value of the resource. In this case, `/foo` holds `{ 'bar': "buzz"}`

**ver**: The version of the resource. Whenever the value of `/foo` changes, `ver` will increment.

**time**: Epoch time representation of when the response was generated.

**msgId**: Each data transmission through the IWC is labeled with a unique message identifier. The
Bus keeps track of message identifiers so that components know to whom they should reply.

**replyTo**: The message identifier of the request that this response was sent because of.
